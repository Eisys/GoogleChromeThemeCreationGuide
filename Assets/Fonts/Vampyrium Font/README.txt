If using an older system, move "Vampyrium Font.tff" into the "Fonts" folder located in the control panel.

Thank "Mod Rowley" and the artist behind the font(I have no idea who that is sadly :c) for the font <3

NOTE FROM ROWLEY(@JagexRowley):
"The tribe symbol letters should always be larger (always capitalised) - that's the A, D, G, J, M, P, S and V - to honour them"
